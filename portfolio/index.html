                    <h3>Meal Planning Tool</h3>
                    <p>This is a project for Greener Village a not-for-profit organization. This tool 
                        facilitates the meal designer to interact with the client and define meal plans.
                        Also meal recipes are available for viewing along with video and instructions.
                        Shopping list is generated based on the meals in the meal plan for easy grocery shopping and planning.

                    <h3>Tamil Flash cards</h3>
                    <p>This is a tool for learning Tamil with its correct pronounciation. I recorded my voices
                        and provided images for easy recognition. It is possible to auto-play the flash cards. The flash 
                        cards are grouped under sets such as alphabets, fruits, animals, etc. The audio plays for each flash card
                        automatically when it is displayed. There is an option to mute. It is also possible to manually navigate 
                        between cards in a set apart from auto play.
